Assignments: [1.1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/recording_technique) | [1.2]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/tech_composition) | [1.3]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/real_composition) | [2.1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/feed_improvisation) | [2.2]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/feedback_composition) | [3.1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/collecting_sounds) | 3.2 | [3.3]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/noise_composition) | [4.1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/basic_max_msp) | [4.2]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/more_max_msp) | [4.3]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/write_proposals) | [4.4]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/complete_project) | [5.1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/you_choose)

  

Again, there are four parts. Warning: **this is a long assignment**. Each should take no more than an hour. You might not get your desired result right away, so experiment a little (just like with Assignments 2.1 and 2.2). **These are not compositions**. Rather, we are developing techniques that **might be useful in making a noise/drone composition**, such as for Assignment 3.3.

1\. **Using your long sounds**, layered as much as you like, **your beautiful sounds**, which you can also layer and process, and **convolution, make a 3–5 minute nice sound**, hopefully with **subtle changes**. You can use **change pitch, change gain, and mix, as well as convolution**, and you can use Pro Tools for layering. Don't forget you can only have one of Pro Tools and Peak open at a time. Label like peter-3.2.1, etc.

2\. **String together**, either in Peak or Pro Tools (using crossfade), **parts of your "scenes," to produce a 20–30 second narrative**. This might not sound that great or interesting, but there is another step: **convolve this narrative with your beautiful sounds** (again which you can work on) to come up with an interesting and nice sounding chunk, not just a drone. Label, etc.

3\. **Make 30-60 seconds of horizontal (linear), temporally changing noise that is not dense. Make it grating, screeching, nasty**. This is not so easy, so don't worry if it doesn't work out well. But learning to do it might help with the next assignment. Label, etc.

4\. **Make 30–60 seconds of vertical dense noise.** Noise doesn't have to sound horrible, nor does it have to resemble white (or other colored) noise. (I'm using the term "noise" advisedly.) Label, etc.
