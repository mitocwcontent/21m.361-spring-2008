1\. Using any recording equipment available to you (MD/DAT/cassette/video/HD/memory recorder, cellphone, computer, dictation thingy, etc.), **record a large number (20ish?) of isolated sounds**. These should be intentionally recorded, i.e., not just plucked from a longer recording session; they will in all likelihood be from a single source (broadly defined), and somehow can be heard as the intended sound. To clarify: these sounds should be short—0.5s to 20s. There are two varieties: sounds you cause to happen, and record; and sounds you just happen to record or find and record, without you causing the sound. Both are acceptable. By single source I don't mean all you sounds should come from the same source; rather, each individual sound has a single source, e.g. a glass being tapped, as opposed to a glass being tapped while someone slurps some soup. **Also record a long sound, 1–2 minutes**. This should not have intentional sounds in it, i.e., don't plan for sounds to happen. Just record a stretch of sound you think will be interesting. Some variety in the sound should make Assignment 1.3 a little easier. In all recordings please avoid bathrooms; when we forget to mention this, we tend to get several bathroom recordings. What happens in the bathroom should stay in the bathroom.

2\. Transfer your sounds to a Pro Tools session **via the auxiliary cable** (and not by importing) onto a single (pair of) track(s). **Edit out everything except your 8 favorite short sounds, and your long sound. Bounce to a single file** (your 8 short sounds followed by your long sound, each separated by small silences long enough for you to be able to announce in class what the sound is) and copy (not move) the file into the ass-1.1 folder, named (with your name) 'peter-1.1.aif.' To copy a file on a Mac®, option-drag it; or highlight it and type command-c, and where you want to put it, command-v. Unless otherwise specified, the only acceptable soundfile format is aif.
