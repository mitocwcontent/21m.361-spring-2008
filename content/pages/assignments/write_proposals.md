1\. **Write a definite proposal, and show initial work, for your final Max project**. See [Assignment 4.4]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/complete_project) for details. I'll look at them in class and suggest revisions. Your initial work should be some serious Max programming, and your proposal should be specific, and feasible.

2\. **Look at Assignment 5.1, and write a clear proposal** of what you intend to do. I will approve it, or make suggestions of how to improve it; once the proposal has been approved/revised, it can't be veered from. Here is [Assignment 5.1]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments/you_choose).
